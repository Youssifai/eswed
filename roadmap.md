# Design Project Management App Roadmap

## Project Overview

We're building a web-based Design Project Management App for designers that serves as a one-stop hub for managing projects efficiently. The app includes user authentication, project creation with three linked pages (Brief, Inspiration, and Project Files), and sophisticated file management capabilities.

## Current State

- Database migrated from Supabase to Neon.tech (PostgreSQL)
- Basic profiles schema implemented with membership status (free/pro)
- Clerk authentication integrated with login/signup pages
- Basic project structure with Next.js app router
- Stripe integration initiated for payment processing

## Tech Stack
