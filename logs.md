   5. **Properly escaped file names in download headers**

   # Fixed Empty ZIP File Issue - 2024-03-19

   ## Comprehensive Debug and Fix for Project Download Functionality

   The "Download All" feature was producing empty or corrupt ZIP files. After thorough investigation and debugging, the following issues were identified and fixed:

   1. **Enhanced Diagnostic Logging**
      - Added detailed logging throughout the download process
      - Tracked each file as it's processed to identify where failures occur
      - Added counters to track successful and failed files
      - Implemented file statistics verification to catch empty archives

   2. **Improved File Detection**
      - Added verification of file existence in Wasabi before attempting to download
      - Added explicit checks for empty or missing Wasabi object paths
      - Fixed error handling to better report when files couldn't be retrieved
      - Validated that the project actually has files before attempting to create archive

   3. **Fixed Stream Handling**
      - Ensured files are properly added to the archive
      - Added success tracking to verify files were actually added
      - Made sure the archive is finalized properly
      - Added output stream close validation

   4. **Empty Archive Prevention**
      - Added explicit size checks for the ZIP file before returning it
      - Added validation of archive contents using the archiver API
      - Implemented an early exit if no files could be processed successfully
      - Created safeguards against premature stream closing

   5. **Better Error Reporting**
      - Enhanced error messages in API responses
      - Added detailed error information to help diagnose issues
      - Implemented proper error propagation through the application
      - Added specific status codes for different error conditions

   The ZIP file download now properly maintains folder structure, correctly includes all files from the project, and produces a valid, non-corrupt archive that can be extracted normally.

   ## Technical Implementation Details

   1. **Stream Processing**
      - Used Node.js streams for efficient file handling
      - Properly managed connections to Wasabi S3 storage
      - Added file size information to archive entries when available
      - Added proper content headers for browser downloads

   2. **Error Handling**
      - Added try/catch blocks around individual file processing
      - Implemented fallback behavior when files can't be retrieved
      - Added detailed logging to identify problematic files
      - Used proper error types for better error reporting

   3. **Configuration**
      - Set appropriate timeouts for larger file downloads
      - Used the Node.js runtime for the API route
      - Set explicit maxDuration to prevent timeouts
      - Optimized archive compression level for better performance

# Development Logs

## Vercel Deployment Optimization - 2024-09-X

### Systematic Approach to Preventing Deployment Issues
- Applied **Pre-Deployment Validation** strategy:
  - Updated runtime configuration in vercel.json to use correct format: `@vercel/node@2.15.3`
  - Fixed maxDuration settings to comply with Vercel free tier limits (60 seconds)
  - Added appropriate memory allocation (1024MB) for optimal performance

- Implemented **TypeScript Enforcement**:
  - Added strictNullChecks to tsconfig.json for more rigorous type checking
  - Enforced noImplicitAny to prevent type-related deployment issues
  - Added forceConsistentCasingInFileNames for better cross-platform compatibility

- Applied **Vercel-Specific Configuration**:
  - Updated webpack config with fallbacks for AWS SDK and Node.js API compatibility
  - Added "aws-crt": false to prevent Edge Runtime compatibility issues
  - Updated next.config.js with optimized settings for build process
  - Added bodyParser size limit increase for improved file upload functionality

- Added **Version Locking Strategy**:
  - Created .npmrc with engine-strict and save-exact for consistent installs
  - Added overrides in package.json to pin critical dependencies to exact versions:
    - @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner: 3.418.0
    - drizzle-orm: 0.29.3
    - @clerk/nextjs: 4.29.9
  - Added Node.js engine requirement (>=18.17.0)

- Integrated **Build Chain Improvements**:
  - Added vercel-build script that runs type-check before building
  - Preserved existing functionality while enhancing type safety
  - Fixed runtime configuration in API routes to ensure correct Node.js environment

## Build Fixes - 2024-09-X

### Fixed Vercel Build Process
- Created/updated `vercel.json` to properly configure serverless functions
  - Set runtime to `@vercel/node@2.15.3` for API routes
  - Limited maxDuration to 60 seconds (Vercel free tier limit)
  - Set memory to 1024MB for optimal performance
- Added explicit runtime configuration in `middleware.ts`
  - Forced Node.js runtime instead of Edge Runtime
  - Prevents issues with Clerk authentication in Edge environment
- Updated `next.config.js` to handle build warnings
  - Added polyfills and fallbacks for Node.js APIs
  - Disabled ESLint during production builds

### Fixed Drizzle ORM Query
- Updated the `searchFiles` function in `db/queries/files-queries.ts` to fix a type error
- Changed the query building approach from chaining multiple `.where()` calls to using a conditions array
- Implemented the `.where(and(...conditions))` pattern to properly handle multiple filter conditions
- This resolved the TypeScript error: "Property 'where' does not exist on type 'Omit<PgSelectBase<...>'"
- Fixed build failure that was preventing successful deployment

## TypeScript Error Fixes - 2024-09-X

### Fixed Type Error with parentId in Upload Dialog
- Updated the `UploadFileDialogProps` interface in `components/upload-file-dialog.tsx`
- Changed `parentId?: string` to `parentId?: string | null` to match `ChunkMetadata` interface
- Ensures proper type compatibility between the component props and the expected API parameters
- This fix prevents build errors caused by type mismatch between `string | undefined` and `string | null`
